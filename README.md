# Spacemacs config #
Features
========
- A c-c++ layer that compliments the "official" c-c++ layer from spacemacs.
  - uses irony, company-irony, company-irony-c-headers, flycheck-irony, clang-format

- An org configuration setup how I think the default setup should be.
  (Probably should put into layer... Maybe someday)
  Uses packages:
  - _pdf-tools_ 
    pdf-annotations are opened in org mode, enabling latex note-taking inside a pdf.
  - _visual-fill-column_
    visual-fill-column-mode is a small Emacs minor mode that mimics the effect of fill-column in visual-line-mode.
    Instead of wrapping lines at the window edge, which is the standard behaviour of visual-line-mode, it wraps lines at fill-column. 
  - _px_, _org-pdfview_
    packages necessary for org to open correctly in pdf annotations with Latex being rendered.
  - _org-indent_
    indents under bullet headers nicely.
